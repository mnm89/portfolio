## What is Zustand?

Zustand is a small yet powerful state management library for React. Unlike Context API, which can cause unnecessary re-renders, Zustand offers **global state with minimal re-renders** and a simple API.

---

## Setting Up Zustand

To install Zustand, run:

```sh
npm install zustand
```

Now, let’s create a basic **store**:

```tsx
import { create } from "zustand";

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increase: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
}));

function Counter() {
  const { count, increase } = useStore();
  return <button onClick={increase}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

Here, `useStore` acts as a **global state store**, and `increase` updates the count without unnecessary re-renders.

---

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. Persisting State

Zustand allows easy state persistence using middleware:

```tsx
import { persist } from "zustand/middleware";

const useUserStore = create(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      user: null,
      setUser: (user) => set({ user }),
    }),
    {
      name: "user-storage", // Persisted in localStorage
    }
  )
);
```

Now, `user` state remains stored across page reloads.

### 2. Selective State Updates

Zustand lets you **subscribe to specific slices of state**, preventing unnecessary re-renders:

```tsx
const count = useStore((state) => state.count); // Only re-renders when count changes
```

This makes Zustand much **more performant** compared to React Context.

---

## Conclusion

Zustand simplifies state management with a **small API, better performance, and persistence support**. It’s an excellent choice for **global state management in React** without the complexity of Redux.
