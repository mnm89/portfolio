## Understanding Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They help improve code maintainability and scalability.

### Common Design Patterns

1. **Singleton** – Ensures only one instance of a class exists.
2. **Factory** – Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic.
3. **Observer** – Establishes a subscription mechanism between objects.

### Example: Singleton Pattern in JavaScript

```js
class Singleton {
  static instance;
  constructor() {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = this;
    }
    return Singleton.instance;
  }
}
```

Design patterns are essential for writing clean and efficient code. Start exploring them to enhance your software development skills!
