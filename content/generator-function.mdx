## What Are Generator Functions?

Generator functions in JavaScript allow you to pause and resume execution, making them useful for handling large data sets, iterators, and even asynchronous workflows.

Unlike regular functions that run to completion once called, generators **yield** values one at a time, allowing controlled execution.

## Defining a Generator Function

A generator function is defined using the `function*` syntax, and it uses the `yield` keyword to pause execution.

```js
function* numberGenerator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const generator = numberGenerator();
console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

Each call to `.next()` resumes execution until the next `yield`, providing fine-grained control over execution.

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. Iterating Over Large Data Sets

Generators can handle large data sets efficiently without consuming too much memory.

```js
function* infiniteCounter() {
  let i = 0;
  while (true) {
    yield i++;
  }
}

const counter = infiniteCounter();
console.log(counter.next().value); // 0
console.log(counter.next().value); // 1
console.log(counter.next().value); // 2
```

Since it generates values **lazily**, it avoids storing unnecessary data in memory.

### 2. Controlling Asynchronous Execution

Generators can work with `yield` to handle async operations sequentially.

```js
function* fetchUserData() {
  const user = yield fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1").then(
    (res) => res.json()
  );
  console.log(user);
}

const generator = fetchUserData();
generator.next().value.then((user) => generator.next(user));
```

This technique was widely used before `async/await` became popular.

## Conclusion

Generator functions are powerful tools for managing iterators, handling large data sets, and simplifying asynchronous workflows.
