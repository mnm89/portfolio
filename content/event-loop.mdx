## What is the JavaScript Event Loop?

JavaScript is **single-threaded**, meaning it can only execute one task at a time. But how does it handle multiple tasks, like fetching data from an API while still responding to user interactions?

Enter the **event loop**—a mechanism that manages asynchronous operations and ensures the execution of callbacks.

## Understanding the Event Loop in Action

To see the event loop in motion, let’s analyze this code snippet:

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside setTimeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Inside Promise"));

console.log("End");
```

### Output:

```
Start
End
Inside Promise
Inside setTimeout
```

### Why This Order?

1. `console.log("Start")` executes first (synchronous code).
2. `setTimeout` is sent to the **Web APIs** (does not block execution).
3. The **Promise** callback goes to the **Microtask Queue**.
4. `console.log("End")` executes.
5. The **Microtask Queue** (Promise callback) executes before the **Callback Queue** (setTimeout).
6. Finally, `setTimeout` executes.

This happens because **Microtasks (Promises, MutationObservers) have higher priority** than Macrotasks (setTimeout, setInterval, etc.).

## Visualizing the Event Loop

Imagine a **to-do list**:

1. JavaScript **executes all synchronous code first** (Main Stack).
2. Asynchronous tasks are sent to **Web APIs** (like `setTimeout`).
3. Once the **Call Stack is empty**, the Event Loop checks the **Microtask Queue** (Promised tasks).
4. After all **Microtasks** are processed, it picks up the **Macrotasks** (setTimeout, I/O).

## Key Takeaways

✅ JavaScript executes synchronous code first.  
✅ Promises (Microtasks) execute before setTimeout (Macrotasks).  
✅ The Event Loop keeps the application responsive by handling async operations.
