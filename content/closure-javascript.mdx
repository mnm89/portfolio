## What is a Closure?

A **closure** is a function that remembers the variables from its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope.

This means a function can "remember" and access variables from where it was created, even after its outer function has finished execution.

---

## Example of a Closure

```js
function outerFunction(outerValue) {
  return function innerFunction(innerValue) {
    console.log(`Outer: ${outerValue}, Inner: ${innerValue}`);
  };
}

const closureExample = outerFunction("Hello");
closureExample("World"); // Output: Outer: Hello, Inner: World
```

Here’s what happens:

1. `outerFunction("Hello")` executes and returns `innerFunction`.
2. Even though `outerFunction` is finished, `closureExample` still has access to `outerValue`.
3. When `closureExample("World")` is called, it **remembers** `outerValue = "Hello"` and prints the output.

---

## Why Are Closures Useful?

Closures are used in **many real-world scenarios**, including:

### 1. Data Privacy

We can use closures to **create private variables** that can’t be accessed directly.

```js
function counter() {
  let count = 0;

  return {
    increment: () => count++,
    getCount: () => count,
  };
}

const myCounter = counter();
myCounter.increment();
console.log(myCounter.getCount()); // Output: 1
console.log(myCounter.count); // Undefined (count is private)
```

Since `count` is inside the closure, it can’t be modified from outside!

---

### 2. Function Factories

Closures allow us to create **functions with pre-configured values**.

```js
function multiplier(factor) {
  return function (number) {
    return number * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10

const triple = multiplier(3);
console.log(triple(5)); // Output: 15
```

Each function (`double`, `triple`) remembers the `factor` it was created with!

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Closures allow functions to "remember" their lexical scope.**  
✅ **They help in data encapsulation, function factories, and maintaining state.**  
✅ **Closures power many JavaScript features like setTimeout, event listeners, and module patterns.**
