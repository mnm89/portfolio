## What is Jotai?

Jotai is a minimalistic state management library for React that simplifies global state handling using **atoms**. Unlike traditional state management solutions, Jotai allows you to define independent units of state that can be shared across components effortlessly.

---

## Getting Started with Jotai

To use Jotai, install it via npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install jotai
```

Now, let’s create a simple **atom** (a unit of state) and use it inside a React component:

```tsx
import { atom, useAtom } from "jotai";

const countAtom = atom(0); // Creating a shared state atom

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useAtom(countAtom);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

Here, `countAtom` holds a shared state that `useAtom` can read and update across components.

---

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. Derived State

Jotai allows atoms to be computed based on other atoms, making it easy to derive state:

```tsx
const countAtom = atom(1);
const doubleCountAtom = atom((get) => get(countAtom) * 2);
```

Now, any component using `doubleCountAtom` will automatically update when `countAtom` changes.

### 2. Async State Handling

You can also create **asynchronous atoms** to handle API requests seamlessly:

```tsx
const userAtom = atom(async () => {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/user");
  return response.json();
});
```

Jotai’s built-in support for async atoms eliminates the need for `useEffect`.

## Conclusion

Jotai provides a lightweight and flexible way to manage state in React applications with **less boilerplate** and **better performance**. It’s a great alternative to more complex state management libraries like Redux.
